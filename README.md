# Gravity-Calculator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxD7koHdQhM this helped with orbit speed since I barely know anything about this kind of stuff

Calculates the minimum speed for a satellite to orbit Earth AND escape velocity!!!
I plan on adding more things like orbit time, etc (idk if I'll actually do that though)

# Accuracy
all tools are fairly accurate, it's also hard to be very precise with gravity calculations
